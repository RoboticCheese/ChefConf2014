# Day 1 - Nick Stinemates - Chef and Docker #

* Intro to Docker: shipping containers for your apps, etc.
* Why containers?
    * Lighter weight than VMs, greater density
* Focus for this year: Full system lifecycle
    * Docker.io - Container management, policy, information
* In theory, announcing Docker 1.0 at DockerCon
* "How many of you have booted a VM? How many in 10ms?"

* Tom Duffield, Chef
* Chef <3 Docker
* Note: The demo from today is VERY early
* Check out the chef-docker cookbook
