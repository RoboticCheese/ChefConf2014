# Day 2 - Jez Humble - DevOps Culture and Practices to Create Flow #

* Lean, flow, the Toyota production line
* Disaster recovery simulation, "I'm going to walk into the DC, turn everything
off, and see how long it takes you to restore service."
* Our production line is code changes, from version control to production
* Jidoka: Automation + people = autonomation
    * To fix the problem, we need to stop the production line and fix it
* Continuous integration is NOT running Jenkins on a feature branch and
ignoring failed builds
* New change in the deployment pipeline is like a hero's journey
    * Slay all the tests in the build, get rewarded with riches of deployment
* HP LaserJet firmware team
    * 2008
        * Spending 15% of time manual testing
        * 5% building features
        * Too much time merging changes between dozens of feature branches
    * "Hey, Product, we need to fix this. Get off our ass for a while!"
* Lean is not about cutting cost. It's about investing to remove waste.
* Read book: 'Toyota Kata'
    * Management's job isn't to tell you what to do. It's to create an
atmosphere of innovation for the people doing the work.
* Lean metrics:
    * Quality - Time to restore service, % unplanned work
    * Cost - Transaction cost of making a change
    * Delivery - Change lead time
    * SSafety - Make changes and experiments safe to fail
* The purpose of automation is to find problems quickly
* Highest predictor of organization performance: Culture of fear vs of
innovation.
* Continuous improvement
* "Continuous is much more often than you think."
* "Don't fight stupid; make more awesome"
